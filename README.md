The Guidance Automation Extensions (GAX) expands the capabilities of Visual Studio by running guidance packages, which automate key development tasks from within the Visual Studio environment. The Guidance Automation Toolkit (GAT) allows authoring of guidance packages.

_Note: This is the open-sourced version of the GAX/GAT 2010 originally built by Microsoft patterns & practices. Microsoft no longer maintains this project and no future releases are planned._
